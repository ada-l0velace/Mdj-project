Brainstorming:
	
	-> General idea: platform, comic book style explanation of the story between each level


	-> Guy gets home from work (CIA or something) sees his wife was murdered by someone
	
	-> Follows him and eventually gets revenge only to find out it was a government conspiracy
	
	-> Takes down the government 

	-> profit
